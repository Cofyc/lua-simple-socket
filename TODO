str, err = sock:read
c, err = sock:readbyte()
    Reads and returns a single byte.
str, err = sock:readstring(delim)
    Reads untile the first occurrence of delim in the input, returning a
    string containing the data up to and including the delimiter. If readstring
    encounters an error before finding an delimiter, it returns the data read
    before the error and the error itself.
str, err = sock:readline
    Return a single line, not including the end-of-line bytes.
err = sock:unreadbyte
    Unreadbyte unreads the last byte.
